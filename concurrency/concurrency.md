### Concurrency in Go
#### Concurrency vs Parallelism
Concurrency is not parallelism. Concurrency means that our application can do more than 1 thing at a time. It doesn't necessarily mean that it will. 

Parallelism is the act of executing more than one task at the same time. This means without concurrnecy, we cannot have parallelism.

Putting the above together, in Go, we can write concurrent programs, but we cannot force them to run in parallel. This is decided by the OS and the Go runtime environment.
The main difference between the concept of concurrency and parallelism is that parallelism implies that multiple tasks run simultaneously, at the same time. Concurrency means that while multiple tasks may be running simultaneously, only one of them would be actively worked on at a given time (basically keep switching between the tasks). 

For example, if we have 3 tasks - Task 1, 2, 3. 
 - b/w t=0 and t=5 work on Task 1
 - b/w t=5 and t=8 work on Task 2
 - b/w t=8 and t=10 work on Task 1 *again*
 - b/w t=10 and t=12 work on Task 3
 - b/w t=12 and t=15 work on Task 2 *again*

 So while there are 3 concurrent task (tasks running simultaneously), only 1 of them ever gets worked on at a given point in time. 

 In cotrast, if we have 3 tasks running parallely - Task 1, 2, 3, it would mean that all 3 of them are being worked on simultaneously.

#### CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)
CSP is the idea of breaking the program into discrete execution units of work (or tasks) which some processes can execute sequentially. So basically one process does some work and then passes the result of that work to something called a `channel`. 
Another process receives that result from this channel and then does some additional work on it (or finishes it) and so on. So these processes are communicating with each other via channels in a sequential manner - which is the main idea behind CSP.

The use of this model is that the processes are independent of each other and can work concurrently as long as there is some syncronization mechanism in place that makes sure of the sequential communication. So CSP makes concurrency patterns like `fan-in`
and `fan-out` easy to implement.

In context of Go language in particular, the processes described above are called `goroutine`s which can communicate with each other via `channel`s.

#### Goroutines
A goroutine is basically a function that can execute concurrently with other goroutines defined in the same program. Goroutines are lightweight and costs just a little more than allocation on the stack space. 

These goroutines are executed by the Go scheduler which is a part of the Go runtime environment. The Go scheduler executes these routines on its own and the programmer does not have any control over when these goroutines would be executed.

The following code sample shows how goroutines are created -
```go
func main() {
    // Some code
    
    // This is a goroutine
    // It is merely an anonymouos inline function that has the keyword 'go' in before the 'func' keyword.
    // The 'go' keyword is responsible for creating goroutines, without the go keyword, this would just be
    // an inline anonymous function.
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("An async task scheduled by the Go scheduler")
    }()

    // NOTE: This goroutine in its current form here will not do anything. This is because declaring it here just
    // informs the Go scheduler that there is a concurrent task that needs to be performed, but the program gets
    // terminated on the next line, which means the scheduler did not have any time to execute this goroutine.
    // WaitGroups can help here - they are explained in the next section.
}
```


#### WaitGroups
WaitGroups are essentially counters which exhibit special behavior when their value reaches 0. Since it is a counter, we can - 
1. Increment it - `Add(delta int)`: Increment counter by the passed delta.
2. Decrement it - `Done()`: Decrement counter by 1.
3. Wait on it - `Wait()`: Blocks the execution of program till the counter value reaches 0.

Typically in Go, there will be a single function that creates all the concurrent tasks, calling `Add` with the number of created tasks and then wait via the `Wait()` method till the counter reaches back 0. Each of the concurrent tasks would call `Done()` when they are complete and so when the last task completes, the block introduced by `Wait()` is removed.

The following code sample showcases the use of WaitGroups - 
```go
func main() {
    // Declare a WaitGroup
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    // Add a concurrent task (the goroutine we created just below this line represents a concurrent task)
    wg.Add(1)
    // Create a goroutine
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Some async work is being done here")
        // Indicate that the concurrent task is now completed
        wg.Done() // Decrements the WaitGroup counter by 1
    }()
    
    // Some regular syncronous code 
    fmt.Println("This is some syncronous work")
    
    // Wait till all concurrent tasks are completed
    // As soon as the counter reaches 0, this call no longer blocks and the execution is resumed.
    wg.Wait()
}
```
